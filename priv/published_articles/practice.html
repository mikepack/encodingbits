<h1>Practice</h1>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I feel it&#39;s important to advocate to a software engineering newcomer, it&#39;s daily practice. Subsequently, I&#39;ll also remind myself that, contrary to the popular proverb, practice does not make perfect. When building software there is no such thing as perfect; it&#39;s merely choosing one more-educated solution over another. Practice is the means by which we gain that education.</p>

<p>Hence, this blog. As I begin to hit what feels like a critical moment in my career, I have to make a decision: should I charge forward and accomplish all that I encounter, or do I slow down and hone in on the essence of software engineering. I&#39;ve deliberated, and deliberated some more. In the quest to sustainably build software for my entire life, I&#39;ve deduced that the only way to refine my educated decisions is to slow down and practice.</p>

<p>Encoding Bits is a vehicle for which I can express existing and forthcoming ideas around the practice of software engineering. What experiments will grow instinctive knowledge about critical decisions? What has simply not worked? Within a team, how can we more effectively produce a cohesive body of work? For me, Encoding Bits is a place for me to practice writing openly, in short form articles, about the crux of formulating, executing, and following up on these pivotal questions.</p>
