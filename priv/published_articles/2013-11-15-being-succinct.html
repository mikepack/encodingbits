<h1>Being Succinct</h1>

<p>Some years ago, I had my first and only client fallout. It&#39;s unfortunate that the client also happened to be my uncle and the project was compelling (a story for another time). After much thought, I&#39;ve concluded the reason for the fallout is something I both created and could have prevented. It all boils down to the succinctness of my communication.</p>

<p>There are times and places for being verbose, but they&#39;re few and far between. In most cases, it&#39;s more beneficial to be verbose in thought, yet succinct in communication. Constructing software for complex systems means everyone involved is juggling a number of facets at any given time. The last thing participants need is a slurry of unnecessary data to parse. What they need are snapshots into key factors. The factors included will vary between contexts, and it&#39;s detremental to include information that isn&#39;t relevant to the receiving parties. It&#39;s important to pick and choose what you want to get accross; peoples&#39; time is valuable.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an art to currating the right words that express the intent of your message without creating fluff or otherwise unneeded characters. It&#39;s a deliberate practice, effort must be put into reducing the number of words. But being succinct doesn&#39;t only involve verbal and textual communication, it also involves physical locality. It can be frustrating to be summoned to a meeting for which you&#39;ll say nothing. Sure, bits and pieces of a two-hour-long meeting might be relevant, but it would be much more worthwhile to touch base afterwards on those minor affairs. All in all, it&#39;s about respecting the time of other people. Taking the extra step to refine the level of communication goes a long way and as I&#39;ve learned from past experience, it can be the difference between a healthy or fallacious relationship.</p>
