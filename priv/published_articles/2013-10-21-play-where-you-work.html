<h1>Play Where You Work</h1>

<p>The advice &quot;live where you work/play&quot; doesn&#39;t quite cut it for me. If I have to choose to live where I work, then I&#39;m sacrificing play time. If I have to live where I play, then I&#39;ll never get the sense that my work is satisfactory. It&#39;s not worth yielding to this dilemma. I would rather play where I work.</p>

<p>Confucius once said, &quot;choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.&quot; What does it mean to love your work as a software engineer? How can we gain a sense of satisfaction without sacrificing the moments that make life fun? Unequivocally, this will differ for everyone. For me, I need to be toying with new ideas, concepts, and tools. I need to be enjoying and embracing the grind of client projects by augmenting my day with hilarious people. I need to evoke the &quot;ah ha&quot; moments that give me the sense of accomplishment as a perpetual student. All of which cannot be done under a rigid organizational structure; freedom gives me the opportunity to find how to play. This is why it&#39;s salient to work for a company that values playtime, so you can play where you work.</p>
