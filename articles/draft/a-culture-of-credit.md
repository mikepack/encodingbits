# A Culture of Credit

In the United States, and worldwide, we love credit. Why? Credit allows us to accomplish things that would otherwise be unachievable. Take for example, buying a house. Based on an individual's monthly income, a bank will issue a loan for the purchase of a home. You may have a medial $50,000 in your bank account, yet you're capable of purchasing a $500,000 home. This concept would seem absurd to the bartering culture of the 1800s, yet we thrive on credit because it allows us to have our cake now and pay for it later.

The software industry suffers from the same luxury. Businesses are capable, and even encouraged, to put immense amounts of debt on the table. In the same sense that consumers are willing to accrue debt to purchase goods they can't afford, businesses are willing to accrue technical debt to purchase features they can't afford. It's often a worthwhile trade-off: features attract customers but the technical debt accrued will likely be invisible for some duration, allowing business to carry on as usual. Credit cards function similarly; they allow us to purchase now, and manage the debt later.

So it's no wonder there are an enormous amount of projects who languish from prolific technical debt; it's ingrained in our social culture. Technical debt can be managed, just like credit card debt. There's a smart way to use technical debt. Paying off credit cards in-full allows us to generate free points. Paying off technical debt allows us to generate free customers. Not everyone is capable of managing technical debt, which is no surprise. In a socioeconomic culture that suffers from frequent bankruptcy, who's to expect we won't fall into the same trap with software?
