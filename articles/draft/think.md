# Think

No really, think. Deliberately think. As the practice of software engineering becomes less research-oriented and more intuition-based, most of the decisions I make tend to be derived from instinct, void of thought. This is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it requires less effort and allows me to write code faster. A curse because it enables me to stride along in contempt.

Set some time apart to do some undisturbed thinking. Nothing else but thinking. No writing, coding, drawing, or elsewise. Just thinking deeply. Deeply enough that you're somewhere between brainstorming and meditation. Focus on an topic and follow through with a sequence of ideas. Only when you're satisfied with your thoughts should you stop thinking. Turning everyday topics into meditative thoughts is likely a useful way to battle off contempt.
