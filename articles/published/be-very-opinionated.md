# Be (Very) Opinionated

It's good to be opinionated. It means you've collected enough auxiliary details to formulate a stance. It doesn't so much matter the stance you take as long as it's well educated. Opinions change over time, too. My opinions today could easily shift based on information I learn tomorrow. They tend to self-validate and solidify over time.

Having strong opinions means you're more likely to either highly succeed or gloriously fail. The light at the end of the tunnel is clear, and it's the execution of such thoughts that leads to innovation. For instance, if it's your opinion that the right tool must be used for a given task, you'll be inclined to utilize the best tool for the job. Only time will tell if this is the correct approach or not, but much exposure and creativity will come along the way. Therefore, the best tool is probably derived from experience, curiosity and speculation.

It's important to realize that opinions are just that, opinions. By their very nature they are subjective and embody fault. Without inherent fault, they may as well be stated as fact. That's why constructing opinions is important, and embracing others' is equally as crucial. With the appreciation that viewpoints morph over time, the best way to continue to hold strong beliefs is to be in constant reevaluation.
