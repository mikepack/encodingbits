# Practice

If there's one thing I feel it's important to advocate to a software engineering newcomer, it's daily practice. Subsequently, I'll also remind myself that, contrary to the popular proverb, practice does not make perfect. When building software there is no such thing as perfect; it's merely choosing one more-educated solution over another. Practice is the means by which we gain that education.

Hence, this blog. As I begin to hit what feels like a critical moment in my career, I have to make a decision: should I charge forward and accomplish all that I encounter, or do I slow down and hone in on the essence of software engineering. I've deliberated, and deliberated some more. In the quest to sustainably build software for my entire life, I've deduced that the only way to refine my educated decisions is to slow down and practice.

Encoding Bits is a vehicle for which I can express existing and forthcoming ideas around the practice of software engineering. What experiments will grow instinctive knowledge about critical decisions? What has simply not worked? Within a team, how can we more effectively produce a cohesive body of work? For me, Encoding Bits is a place for me to practice writing openly, in short form articles, about the crux of formulating, executing, and following up on these pivotal questions.
